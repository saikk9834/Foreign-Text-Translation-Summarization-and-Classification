# Foreign Text Translation, Summarization, and Classification

## Overview

This NLP (Natural Language Processing) project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for translating Hindi articles into English, summarizing the translated content, and classifying the articles into one of five predetermined categories - Entertainment, Tech, Sports, Politics, Business. The project combines various NLP techniques and machine learning models to deliver accurate and efficient results for multilingual text processing.

## Features

- Translation of Hindi articles into English
- Summarization of translated content for concise understanding
- Classification of articles into five pre-defined categories - Entertainment, Tech, Sports, Politics, Business
- Support for handling multiple articles simultaneously
- High accuracy and performance for efficient processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for development)
- GPU with CUDA support (optional, for faster processing)

### Usage

1. Prepare the input Hindi articles that you want to translate, summarize, and classify. Save them in a text file (e.g., `input_articles.txt`), with one article per line.

2. Run the main script to perform translation, summarization, and classification:

```bash
python nlp_project.py --input input_articles.txt --output output_results.txt
```

3. The translated, summarized, and classified results will be saved in the `output_results.txt` file.

## Model Training

The project uses pre-trained models for translation, summarization, and classification. However, if you wish to retrain the classification model on a custom dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a labeled dataset with Hindi articles and their corresponding categories.

2. Use the dataset to train a text classification model. You can use popular NLP libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn for this purpose.

3. Replace the existing classification model in the project with your custom-trained model.

4. Test the new model's performance and fine-tune as needed.
